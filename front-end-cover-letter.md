Hi **There** !

You’re looking for a **Front-End Web Developer** this is exactly what I specialise in. Talk about a perfect match!

I’ll keep this short and we can go into more details when we chat.

Before anything else, I know you’re probably curious to see my work. Please have a look at my Upwork portfolio: https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~01a2355831aecca8e7/ or alternatively, you can also view samples of my work here: http://rahmandikahaekal.github.io/Kaltem

As you can see from my samples, I enjoy working with **clients that take good design seriously**. I took the time to check out your website and you certainly fit the bill **350** Insert this statement only if applicable and you have actually been able to review the website. If possible mention something specific about their business or website so it proves you actually have taken the time. Before we start working together, I will **review your existing design assets, discuss software specifications and interview you about your visual brand. (What can I say, I like to get to know my clients!)** I will **also explain my process, my design personality and creation timelines**.

I’d love to chat with you over Skype to see if we’re a good fit for each other. I am available **six time on a week** (**except on Wednesday**) between **6am - 6pm, but it's relative usually more than 12 clock**.  My skype name is: **rahmandika haekal**

I look forward to our chat. Have a great day!

Thanks 
**Rahmandika Haekal**
